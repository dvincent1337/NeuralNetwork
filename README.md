<h1> NeuralNetwork </h1>

This is a Java library for creating artificial neural networks.
It can: 
<ul>
<li> Create Neural Networks </li>
<li> Train Neural Networks using backpropagation, optimized with linear algebra </li>
<li> Run Neural Networks </li>
<li> Debug with testing functions </li>
</ul>

The digitInput.txt is a matrix with 5000 20px by 20px images. The digitOutput.txt gives the correct digit for each of the 5000 images. (Each row of the matrix is one image, so digit Input is a 5000x400 matrix and digitOutput is a 5000x10 matrix).

Note: this library requires the jblas linear algebra library. (jblas.org)

Note: this library has only been tested on Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 x64)
