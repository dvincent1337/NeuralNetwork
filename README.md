This is a Java library for createing artificial neural networks.
It can:  Create the neural networks,Train the neural networks,Run the neural networks, Debug with testing functions.

The digitInput.txt is a matrix with 5000 20px by 20px images. The digitOutput.txt gives the correct digit for each of the 5000 images. (Each row of the matrix is one image, so digit Input is a 5000x400 matrix and digitOutput is a 5000x10 matrix).

Note: this library requries the jblas linear algebra library. (jblas.org)
